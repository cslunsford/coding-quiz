# Coding Quiz

## Description

This project was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a coding student to test and review their knowledge on JavaScript through a short quiz. The user simply hits the start button, and has sixty seconds to answer five multiple choice questions by clicking on the answer they believe to be correct. Once an answer is selected, the quiz proceeds to the next question. Should the user answer a question wrong, the timer is reduced by ten seconds and their score does not increase. Correct answers, however, increase a user's score by twenty points for a maximum of one hundred. The quiz is completed when one of two conditions are met: either the timer running out, or all questions being answered. The user will see their score upon completion and will be asked to submit their initials to be recorded in the high scores. The top ten high scores can be viewed on the page by clicking on the view high scores button in the top left corner.
